    <h1>Lei Mao</h1>
    <p>Hi! I am a master's student and research assistant working with Dr. Stephanie Valencia at the Human-Computer Interaction Lab at the University of Maryland. Before this, I worked as a research assistant with Dr.Guihuan Feng at Human-Computer Interaction Lab at Nanjing University. I completed my bachelor at Xiamen University. 
        
        My research centers on designing, developing, and evaluating augmentative and alternative communication (AAC). I am passionate about exploring the integration of AI and embodied robotics into assistive technology, based on the theory of Research through Design (RtD).Â </p>
